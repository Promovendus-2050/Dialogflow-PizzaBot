# Dialogflow-PizzaBot
Building a Pizza order-taking chatbot using Google Cloud Developer Tool's Dialogflow API

Includes 'Default Welcome Intent' and 'OrderPizzaIntent'

Default welcome intent generates greets for new customer using a set of random, formal greetings

Order Pizza Intent contains the main intents for "PizzaBot". 
Note that PizzaBot takes inputs in order - size, ingredients, crust, specials.

"Order Received..." indicates completion of order and ends conversation with customer.

Yet to add - Name and phone number of customer, as confirmation of order / follow-up to Order Received Response.

Hope you find this chatbot structure useful. Ciao!
